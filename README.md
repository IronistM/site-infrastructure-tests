#GenericTest4AnalyticsProject

This project contains code that you can use to build your own test suite.

## How it works

A JSON file (testdescription.json) contains all pages to be tested along with their tests. If you run the test, the AllTests test suite reads that file, then generates a dynamic test suite for each page. All of those will then run.
